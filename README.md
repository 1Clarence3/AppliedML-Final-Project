### Summary
We investigated which demand and supply factors most strongly influence US county-level housing price growth from 2012 to 2022. Using engineered features like income and permit counts, we trained both linear and random forest models with cross-validation. After finding comparable performance, we focused on the linear model to analyze how feature importance varies by region over time. Beta trends showed median income as a stronger predictor than permits, with opposite correlations to price growth. Finally, a valuation heatmap highlighted Florida, New Jersey, Washington, and Nevada as States with potentially lots of undervalued counties and a place to buy houses.
